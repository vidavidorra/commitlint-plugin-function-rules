## Install

```shell
npm install --save-dev commitlint-plugin-function-rules @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional
```

## Usage

Use this plugin in your project's [**commitlint**][commitlint] configuration by specifying it as item in the `plugins` array. All rules have same name as rules that are [available in **commitlint**][rules], but with the `function-rules` prefix. The example `commitlint.config.js`, or `commitlint.config.cjs` if the package is an ES module, shows the usage of a function rule.

> **Note** The available rules are the same as in [**commitlint**][commitlint], so it is recommended to disable the [**commitlint**][commitlint] rule when specifying a function rule to avoid undefined behaviour.

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional'],
  plugins: ['commitlint-plugin-function-rules'],
  rules: {
    'header-max-length': [0], // level: disabled
    'function-rules/header-max-length': [
      2, // level: error
      'always',
      (parsed) => {
        // Allow longer headers for commits with "deps" scope.
        if (parsed.scope === 'deps' && parsed.header.length <= 200) {
          return [true];
        }
        return [false, 'deps header must not be longer than 200 characters'];
      },
    ],
  },
};
```
